arduino-cameratrap
==================

A cameratrap built on Seeeduino Stalker V2.3, with long lasting battery life and some nice settings to configure it.

Parts used:

Seeeduino Stalker V2.3

I2C 16x2 LCD

10kOhm Poti

Pushbutton

some jacks for camera connection

As I only own Nikon, this system will work with Nikon Cameras.
